        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            There are many definitions of communication, and one of them is that it is the
            transmission of information, some message from the sender to the receiver,
            where the speech circuit is not interrupted. Message transmission will be more
            successful if the sender and receiver use the same code. The word communication comes from the Latin verb
            communicare, meaning to share, to communicate, to
            be in a relationship. Communication is one of the basic existential needs, and it is
            particularly important to take care of successful communication in the teaching
            process. The basic division of communication is to verbal and non-verbal, that is,
            to interaction using words or non-verbal signs. Verbal communication is based
            on communication skills, especially on speaking and listening skills. Listening
            is a communication skill that includes directing, interpreting and remembering
            what we heard, and passive listening (to hear) differs from active listening (to
            listen). Furthermore, it is a skill that needs to be mastered, and especially during
            online classes, it has been shown that active listening requires concentration,
            attention and focus on the lecture. Verbal communication is the basis of educational communication, its
            nature in the teaching process is basically didactic.
            Non-verbal communication consists of many non-verbal signs. Research has
            shown that it is much more important than the verbal one in understanding the
            message, as well as human behaviour. Each sign has its own meaning and it can
            vary from culture to culture. The relationship between teacher and student is
            based on communication from the very moment they enter the classroom, and
            it continues with greeting. Students read the non-verbal signs of their teachers,
            and therefore every lecturer should take care not only of how to convey knowledge as efficiently as
            possible, but also how to communicate with students as
            successfully as possible. In addition to the theoretical determination of the term
            communication, the basic division, listing and coding of non-verbal signs in class,
            the paper will also list the challenges and opportunities in the implementation
            of the teaching process during the coronavirus pandemic. For communication in
            the teaching process to be successful, it must be based on the harmony between
            verbal and non-verbal signs.
