        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            With the implementation of the first national exams among primary school students (8th grade) in Croatia in
            2022 and the publication of the results, now more
            than ever before, the profession and the public began to call for complete changes in assessment within the
            education system of primary schools and/or the methods and conditions of enrollment in secondary schools.
            The main reason given
            for this is the impossibility of objective comparison of the knowledge of students
            who come from different schools, i.e. the impossibility of valid selection of students for enrollment in
            secondary schools based on final grades from primary
            40
            school, which results from subjective internal assessment. The complete reform
            of the primary school assessment, as well as the method of selecting students for
            continuing (secondary) education, is certainly one of the challenges of the education system. Motivated by
            the above, the authors will analyze the existing grading
            system and the functions of grades in basic compulsory education in Croatia, as
            well as the existing model of enrollment in secondary schools. Based on theoretical considerations and on
            insight into the good practices of other countries,
            the authors will present their tentative proposal for changing the existing assessment system in primary
            schools in Croatia and the possibility of changing the
            way students are enrolled in secondary schools.
