        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            One of the greatest merits of the French philosopher Michel Foucault is his teaching about power structures
            in society, pointing out the importance of space in
            researching the relationship between power, knowledge and language. He dealt
            with those topics in a large number of his works, especially in his Madness and
            Civilisation (1961), The Order of Things (1966) and Discipline and Punish (1975).
            66
            Starting from two basic Foucaultian hypotheses that knowledge manifests itself
            in order, standardization, and theoretical and ideological motivation as knowledge/power in a network of
            relationships that are very often only implicit, and that
            power has a relational character and as such it is the reason for the existence of
            both buildings and institutions (although it is neither an institution, nor a structure, nor an ability
            possessed by only a few, but rather a product of a complex
            strategic situation in a given society). In this paper we investigate the role of the
            museum as a building of knowledge/power that educates visitors and, in particular, the role of experiential
            learning that is happening in such places (David A.
            Kolb and others).
            We want to see what happens when the body becomes a metonym of a physical
            (spatial) archive, and how virtual reality technology affect our understanding of
            the past (we will relate here to recent researches conducted in Croatia that are
            related to the Vukovar Homeland War Museum), at the same time, we will investigate whether parallel
            narratives, and here in particular, peace-related narratives,
            can contribute to the experiential learning by opening new space for dealing with
            trauma. Here we will refer to the in-depth interviews with participants in grassroot peace activities during
            1991–1995 and 2021, which are part of the on-going
            research of the author for the University of Utrecht.
