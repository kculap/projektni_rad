        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Interdisciplinarity—including its cognate transdisciplinarity—is a hallmark
            of contemporary knowledge production. The term is omnipresent in science,
            technology, and economy as well as in society and higher education—fuelling
            the rhetoric of present-day knowledge politics. But what does interdisciplinarity
            stand for? What is, what was, and what should interdisciplinarity be, particularly
            for the future of our knowledge production?
            Starting from the diagnosis that interdisciplinarity has lost its critical momentum and its original spirit,
            the need for a Philosophy of Interdisciplinarity is
            sketched. In light of the ambivalence of the technosciences and the challenge of
            sustainable development, this engaged philosophy provides a critical-reflexive
            perspective on interdisciplinarity—and it draws a line between a strategic-instrumentalist and a
            critical-reflexive view of interdisciplinarity. In this presentation
            I expose different understandings of inter- and transdisciplinarity and set out a
            foundation for a critique of innumerable usages of these hyped terms. The talk
            starts by presenting a plurality of motives behind these notions, followed by criteria characterizing the
            semantic core of the notions, namely (i) the existence of
            (disciplinary or academic) boundaries and (ii) the transgression or overcoming
            of those boundaries. Based on the dialectic consideration of boundaries and with
            reference to well-established distinctions in the philosophy of science, a plurality
            of four types is shown: interdisciplinarity with regard to (a) objects, (b) knowledge/theories concepts, (c)
            methods/practices, and (d) problems/issues.
            Different philosophical thought traditions can be related to the four types. All
            four types can be illustrated by research programs that are labelled “interdisciplinary”: nanoresearch,
            complex systems theory/chaos theory, biomimicry/bionics, and technology assessment/sustainability research.
            In this paper, special
            emphasis is given to the complex relation between interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity. Arguments
            favouring a critical-reflexive concept of problem-oriented interdisciplinarity going beyond what is
            typically associated with transdisciplinarity are presented. This terminological clarification constitutes
            the very
            basis for the Philosophy of Interdisciplinarity
