        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Interdisciplinarity emerged as a new scientific paradigm in the second half of
            the 20th century. Although research has been undertaken so far that deal with
            its development abroad, there has been no research that would reveal something
            about its beginnings in the Republic of Croatia. One of the ways to find out information about this is by
            searching databases. This research was conducted as
            part of the internal one-year research plan Croatian Social Sciences and Humanities
            Scholars’ Assessments of Interdisciplinarity, which is carried out by the Osijek Centre for
            Interdisciplinary Research and financed by the Faculty of Humanities and
            Social Sciences in Osijek. This plan aims to examine the representation and characteristics of theoretical
            considerations of interdisciplinarity in the professional
            and scientific literature of Croatian scientists from the fields of social sciences
            and humanities. It was launched at the beginning of 2022, and we participated in
            it as student researchers in June and September of the same year.
            In the presentation, we will put forward the results of the analysis carried out
            based on a search of authors from the social sciences and humanities and those
            of their works written on the subject of interdisciplinarity, as well as those of
            their works in which they applied an interdisciplinary approach. These results
            reveal the following: which databases contain the most papers on the project topic; which sciences and
            disciplines from the field of social sciences and humanities most often integrate knowledge and methods from
            other scientific fields;
            which authors predominate in such endeavors; and when were such works created. This research can serve as a
            basis for further research on interdisciplinarity
            in social sciences and humanities in Croatia.
