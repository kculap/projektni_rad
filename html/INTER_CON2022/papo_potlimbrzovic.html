        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Blaženka Despot (1930–2001) was a Croatian philosopher and sociologist who,
            as Ivana Skuhala Karasman claims in 2017, was also occupied with the topics
            of “humanism, technology, feminism, new age, scientific progress and idleness.”
            That the topic of scientific progress was very much in the interest of her deliberations is also evidenced
            by her records on specialization, i.e. the tendency in
            science that appeared at the end of the 19th and prevailed almost throughout the
            20th century. Her records about this phenomenon can be found, for instance, in
            her text “Classness of Craft-Idiocy”. She published this text for the first time in
            1976 in the edition entitled Ideology of Production Forces and the Production Force
            of Ideology, in the form of a presentation that she gave in the autumn of the same
            year at the scientific conference Problems and Perspectives of Interdisciplinary Work
            and Education. Under the same title, but in a somewhat shortened and revised
            version, she published a text about the classness of craft-idiocy a year later, i.e.
            in 1977, in the first of two volumes of the book of proceedings based on the papers presented at the
            aforementioned conference, edited by Božo [Božidar] Jušić
            (1929–2016).
            In these texts, Despot condemned specialization, recognizing it as the cause of
            the emergence of ‘craft-idiocy’ or, as she also called this phenomenon, ‘fachidiotism’. She directed her
            criticism towards contemporary aspirations in two areas of
            human action: labor and science. Namely, she believed that specialization is an
            inevitable consequence of labor division, which caused the creation of laborers
            who are experts in only one aspect of the labor process, thus creating the so-called ‘craft-idiots’.
            Analogous to her understanding of the consequences of labor
            division and specialization, she was convinced that specialization in science has
            led to the same outcome, i.e. to the creation of scientific laborers who are only
            familiar with the narrow field of their scientific interest. In addition to criticism,
            Despot also offered a solution to problems brought about by specialization: the
            renewal of the entire educational system in the direction of individuals’ acquisition of self-awareness,
            which she equated with knowledge, which will lead to
            “turning laborers into humans.”
