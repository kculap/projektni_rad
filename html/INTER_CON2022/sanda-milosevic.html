        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Supporting students in learning implies a rational organization and intensification of the teaching process
            adapted to the individual abilities of the students.
            Due to subjective and objective reasons, individual differences among students
            are not sufficiently respected in our schools. Classes are usually conducted as
            if all students in the class are capable of equal tasks. Existing textbooks were
            written with the assumption that all students can use them equally successfully.
            In such circumstances, the role of teachers and their ability to recognize the individual differences of
            their students is crucial for the successful realization of
            the measurement instruments in pedagogy that are available in modern science,
            which make it possible to significantly identify the level of student development.
            Using the means of objective examination, systematic observations and studying
            data on student’s progress in classes, it is possible to know the level of maturity of an individual student
            and thus create a realistic basis for harmonizing
            the teaching with the student’s capabilities. In addition to the measurements and
            monitoring that the teacher continuously performs in his work with the students,
            it is necessary to include pedagogues who will use pedagogical measurement instruments to examine the
            quantitative aspects of the student’s development more
            accurately. Cooperation with the family is also a very important aspect in the
            effort to provide each student individually with the most suitable way of working
            in order to achieve greater success of teaching process.
            Most teachers are aware of the fact that there are individual differences among
            students, but relatively only few of them fully understand the importance and
            significance of the magnitude of these differences. The research carried out in
            Public institution Elementary School “Mladen Stojanović” collects the attitudes
            and opinions of teachers, students and parents about the current level of support
            for students in learning and behavior through online questionnaires. The general
            goal of the research is to determine how good is the communication of all participants in the teaching
            process (student-teacher-parent-pedagogical service),
            and how much supplementary and additional teaching and individual monitoring of student progress support
            students in learning. The subject of the research
            is the quality and degree of support that students receive in the framework of
            curricular and extracurricular activities, the involvement of teachers in order to
            adapt the lessons to the individual needs of students and bring the teaching material closer to the
            students’ interests, the interest of students in free and additional activities that help them master the
            material and achieve the best results.
