        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Set up in the ashes of WWII, the intellectual spearhead of the UN – the United Nations Educational,
            Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) aims at
            fostering peace among people across national borders via intellectual cooperation. The leaders of UNESCO and
            intellectual elites of Member States helped to
            shape the organ’s view of the relations between science, education, culture, and
            global development. This paper will look at the emergence, evolution, and legacy
            of UNESCO’s approach toward global development during the first two decades
            since its inception. Born out of the Conference of Allied Ministers of Education
            (CAME) discussion, the post-war UN agency took not only education and culture
            but also science in its scope of action, leading to the synonym of UNESCO instead of “UNECO.” The scientific
            dimension in UNESCO was firstly embodied by
            the 1st Director-General Julian Huxley’s and Joseph Needham’s view of scientific humanism, which emphasized
            the development of the backward or undeveloped areas for the general progress of humanity. Growing out of
            this intellectual
            vein, UNESCO launched several initiatives, including a global network of Field
            Science Cooperation Office (FSCO) and Fundamental Education (FE) pilot project
            outside developed West Europe. The latter FE, an experimental education-driven
            development scheme, is coined as the origin of the UNESCO prototype of UN
            developmentalism. This paper will take FSCO and FE as examples to investigate
            UNESCO’s scientific and humanistic approach toward global development. However, the ideally designed program
            for both FSCO and FE had to dance with cold
            war politics, colonial and de-colonial and post-colonial tensions, lack of funding,
            inter-agency competition, etc., which marked a turning point for UNESCO’s mission of deploying education and
            science for global development and turning to
            a more mediated role of norm setter. UNESCO’s scientific humanist approach to
            global development vividly presented the overarching and self-expanding tendency of UNESCO’s program. Its
            involvement in global development went far
            beyond its action of scope and financial capability and unavoidably interwoven
            itself with the hectic politics at the international/national and local levels. Nevertheless, this paper
            also recognized the merits of UNESCO in exploring and experimenting with the link between education,
            science, and development, which
            resonates significantly with the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals.
