        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Visibly changed socio-economic circumstances in modern times are also reflected in the school system and
            cause permanent crises of education in the world.
            There is agreement among scientists that it is necessary to adopt a new philosophy of education in order to
            solve the problems of the 21st century. However, the
            educational reality is such that changes are not welcomed. Schools are not open
            to more thorough modifications and new solutions, despite having the potential to prevent an educational
            disaster. The seriousness of the situation deserves
            the maximum engagement of all teaching participants, especially the creators of
            educational policies, in order to revise the traditional curriculum, or replace it
            with a new one that will optimize learning and teaching experiences. An effective
            pedagogy of possibilities that would ensure this must, first of all, be deprived of
            the long-dominant, hopeless pedagogical coddling. The aim of this paper is to
            map and analyze the assumptions for redesigning school systems. A review of
            the literature has shown that it is necessary to step away from the usual ways of
            learning and teaching and to encourage the development of authentic patterns of
            cognition, experience and action. In synthesizing findings from numerous studies, it is evident that the
            emphasis must be on transferable skills that will empower students and maximize their potential.
            Consequently, educational activity in
            preparing children and young people for the future should be directed in several
            directions. First, in the most recognized theoretical conceptualizations, critical
            thinking is established as a crucial skill needed for life and work in the (post)information society.
            Active, critical questioning of reality, analysis, interpretation
            and evaluation of a problem contributes to intellectual flexibility, which creates
            preconditions for modification of beliefs and actions. Second, the curriculum
            82
            should be based on the principles of creativity. It is plausible to conclude that
            creativity represents one of the key skills for the progress and well-being of individuals and society.
            Technological development is unthinkable without the creative contributions of community members. However,
            given that today’s society
            is profit-oriented, it is increasingly challenging to reconcile the values of care,
            compassion and general well-being with the need for economic pragmatism.
            In this regard, the third postulate states that a spiritual transformation is needed, in order to use
            knowledge for humane constructive purposes, to achieve the
            common good. It is about wisdom that achieves its legitimacy through ethically acceptable and responsible
            motives, aspirations and actions. Teaching about
            wisdom, teaching for wisdom and teaching with wisdom should contribute to
            equipping children and young people to make the right decisions. Finally, there
            is no wise, creative, or critical thinking without knowledge. Knowledge is gained
            through dialogue, communication and interaction of individuals with the environment. At the same time, the
            most long-lasting is the knowledge constructed
            through the active engagement of students in the teaching process. Participating
            in the processes of knowledge construction strengthens the student’s research
            curiosity and makes a real departure from mental rigidity. All these skills should
            be woven into the modern curriculum and set in the form of curricular requirements. In the paper, we analyze
            the listed skills while emphasizing that the goals
            belonging to them cannot be achieved by campaign measures, but only by discipline-oriented interventions.
