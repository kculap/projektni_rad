        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            The 2022 International Interdisciplinary 2nd Congress focuses on “Challenges of Education”. This theme
            raises the question of what roles inter- and transdisciplinarity play in fostering the kind of teaching and
            learning needed for the
            21st century. All aspects of our lives are affected by changes in the nature of work
            and life, driven by social, political, economic, and technological developments
            that are occurring on a global scale. Complex societal problems loom large in
            this scenario, including climate change, disease, inequality, and conflict. The
            kind of learning that is needed requires balancing skills of cognitive and social
            integration. Moreover, learning for the 21st century is a form of lifelong learning that extends beyond the
            notion of adult education: spanning earliest years of
            schooling, professional development in the workplace, and ongoing participation in civil society. This
            keynote address draws insights from drivers of change
            that are making critical thinking, collaboration, creativity, problem solving, and
            crossdisciplinary integration and synthesis crucial for understanding the complexity, uncertainty,
            volatility, and ambiguity of complex intellectual and societal problems. They are facilitated in significant
            part by Deborah DeZure’s notion of productive pedagogies that foster active, experiential, and
            discovery-based
            learning. In addition to an overview of competencies for inter- and trans-disciplinary research and
            education, the talk will situate them in concepts of pragmatic
            constructivism, reflective equilibrium, and transdisciplinary orientation. Given
            our host is the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research of the Faculty of Humanities
            and Social Sciences in Osijek, it will also address structures and strategies for not
            only bridging humanities and social sciences but also their relations with science
            and technology.
