        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Today, education is highly promoted among the development priorities of all countries with the aim of
            national development and prosperity. Regardless of the
            country, they all strive for the most successful education possible, considering
            44
            that education directly affects economic development. McKinsey & Company compared 25 world education systems
            that achieved above-average results in 2007.
            Comparison of those systems resulted in a conclusion that successful education
            systems share three key characteristics: 1) persuading (encouraging) individuals
            to become teachers; 2) enabling individuals to become effective practitioners; 3)
            ensuring the best possible conditions for learning.
            Looking at global education systems, it can be concluded that the general opinion
            is that Singapores’ education system is extremely successful, as evidenced by the
            results of the PISA survey (counting all cycles since Singapore has participated in
            this testing). On the other hand, according to the parameters of PISA testing, the
            Croatian education system achieves (below) average results, since the beginning
            of participation in this type of testing. In order to get insights in the similarities
            and differences between these two systems, this paper will use the method of
            system comparison according to certain elements of the analysis, observing the
            time period of the last 30 years. The planned elements of the analysis are as follows: a) social
            specificities; b) educational changes and reforms; c) educational
            levels; d) initial teacher education; e) PISA results. The data will be collected by
            the method of working on documentation, considering OECD (Organisation for
            Economic Cooperation and Development) publications, by reviewing the websites of
            the ministries of education, and by analysing laws and regulations. The results of
            the comparison will make it possible to determine the current state of the Croatian education system, as
            well as its good and bad sides.
