        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            The world of the 21st century owes its development largely to multiculturalism.
            However, the numerous challenges that modern societies face are the result of
            globalization, and multiculturalism. By promoting multicultural societies into
            societies that nurture intercultural relations among their members, it is possible
            to prevent or alleviate numerous animosities that occur between different social
            and cultural groups. In this paradigm shift, teachers have one of the fundamental roles. If it is taken into
            account that it is not possible to transfer knowledge
            and skills that are not possessed, the modern education system faces at least
            50
            two challenges in terms of intercultural education. On the one hand, it should
            be adapted to the acquisition and development of intercultural competence of
            teacher education studies students, while at the same time it would have to train
            (future) teachers with methodical and didactic skills to effectively transfer the
            acquired competence to their students. Since multicultural experiences are considered the most effective
            forms of acquiring intercultural sensitivity, which is
            a prerequisite for the acquisition of intercultural competence, the educational
            system must simultaneously take into account both the experiences gained by
            teachers and those gained by students, without neglecting other equally important aspects of education.
