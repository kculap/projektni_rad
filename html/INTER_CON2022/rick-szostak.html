        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Universities around the world are introducing courses about interdisciplinary
            analysis. Inevitably, these courses are often taught by instructors that are relatively new to the vast
            literature in the field of interdisciplinary studies. I will in
            this talk draw on both that literature and my own experience as an instructor to
            suggest several important guidelines for instructors to follow in teaching about
            interdisciplinarity. For example, material about how to best perform interdisciplinary analysis is best
            appreciated while actually doing so. Students should be
            encouraged to discuss the challenges they are facing in their own research: other students will often have
            great advice, and instructors with (even limited) familiarity with the interdisciplinary research process
            will also have useful advice
            (even if they are not immediately confident that this will be the case). In such an
            environment, students think deeply about their (and others’) research projects
            and tend to produce very impressive results. Instructors should be conscious that
            we are trying to convey a set of interdisciplinary attitudes along with a set of interdisciplinary skills.
            My general lesson is positive: With a bit of effort, novice
            instructors can do a great job of guiding interdisciplinary students. They need,
            though, to be clear about what skills and attitudes they are trying to encourage.
