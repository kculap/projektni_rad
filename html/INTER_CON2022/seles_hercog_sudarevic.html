        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            The development of technology led to the fact that the process of transferring,
            storing, processing and forwarding information was supported at an accelerated
            pace. This consequently influenced the development of the knowledge industry
            in all segments, from education itself to the development of mass media as often primary sources of
            information. Information thus becomes a fundamental
            development potential. The amount of information that circulates every day has
            made it necessary to use it effectively. Through the experience and practice examples gained by working in
            the City and University Library Osijek as information librarians, the authors saw a lack of information
            literacy and the skills that
            define it, among a large number of users. The paper focuses on users who are
            students of four-year high schools who, by graduating, fulfill the prerequisite for
            admission to college. Through research conducted among students of ten high
            schools in Osijek, the framework of their knowledge of searching, using and recognizing the relevance of
            information will be defined.
            The comfort and creation of one’s own conditions provided by the environment
            in which information is searched, as well as unlimited access time, are the advantages of using the Internet
            as a source of information, which is why it is often
            the first source that users turn to. However, there are also many shortcomings
            that are almost devastating, especially considering the accuracy and timeliness
            of data that users consider relevant. Because of the above, it is necessary to develop a model of informal
            education Basics of Information Literacy intended for
            students of the mentioned schools. This introduces them to the way of searching
            and using information that helps them in learning, but also in writing seminars
            and other papers that they need during their education. Also, such informal education can serve as the
            acquisition of prior knowledge for the needs of writing
            papers during higher education.
