        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Educational learning environment is very important because it affects getting
            knowledge and skills. In order to enable students to achieve their full potential,
            teachers must adapt the teaching process to different students’ needs as well as to
            the educational environment in which the teaching process takes place. In order
            to do this, teachers need to possess the competencies that will enable them to do
            so. In vocational education, the educational environment also includes spaces
            that authentically show work in the occupation for which the student is being
            educated, and in which work-based learning is carried out. For example, these
            46
            are woodworking workshops, forests, specialized workshops equipped with machines, tools and devices, as well
            as kitchens. The vocational curriculum for obtaining the general care nurse qualification is carried out in
            both school and clinical environment. The school environment includes spaces such as general-purpose
            classrooms and specialized practicums similar to a patient’s room and a
            room for performing medical-technical procedures. In them, skills are acquired
            before continuing the teaching process in a clinical environment, which can involve clinical surroundings,
            retirement homes, and kindergartens. Teaching in
            the abovementioned conditions is carried out by personnel who impart professional knowledge and experiential
            skills. The issue of the work is focused on interdisciplinarity in professional education during the
            realization of work-based
            learning in the educational sector “Health and social care”.
