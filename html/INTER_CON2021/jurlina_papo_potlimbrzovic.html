        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, during spring of 2020 Republic of Croatia had
            introduced a lockdown due to which learning in higher education took on the characteristics of online
            learning. Since lockdown and compulsory online learning were
            unprecedented in Croatian history, we have examined the attitudes of Josip Juraj
            Strossmayer University of Osijek’s students on online learning during the lockdown.
            We have found that students’ attitudes towards online learning were slightly negative, and proved the
            applicability of the technology acceptance model.
            Despite the fact that lockdown is no longer present in Croatia, learning has retained
            most of the characteristics acquired during that period until the academic year of
            2021/2022. Because of that we have decided to examine the Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek
            students’ attitudes towards online learning once again and
            connect them to the perceived ease of use of tools, to the perceived usefulness of online
            learning and to some socio-demographic variables. In doing so, we acquired the prerequisites for comparing
            the results of both studies and testing the statistical significance of their difference. The convenience
            sample was made up of 229 students, and
            the data has been collected via an online questionnaire during July, August and September of 2021. The
            results have shown that the average students’ attitude is slightly
            negative, however the population parameter is, judging by the confidence interval,
            between slightly negative and neutral. The attitude and the perceived usefulness did
            not change to the point of statistical significance compared to our previous research,
            whereas the perceived ease of use of tools for online learning has shown statistically
            significant growth. The indirect connection of the perceived ease of use of tools and the
            attitude, as well as the mediation effect of the perceived usefulness of online learning
            have been confirmed once again. We attribute the insignificant growth of the average students’ attitude
            towards online learning, despite the significant growth of the
            perceived ease of use of tools, to the insignificant growth of the perceived usefulness of
            online learning, which is in accordance with the theory acceptance model.
