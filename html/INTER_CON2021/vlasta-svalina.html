        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Today’s world is changing rapidly, therefore both teachers/educators and learners/
            trainees should follow the latest trends in education. Since lifelong learning is nothing new in European
            countries, it is slowly becoming part of our lives, too. Using
            modern technologies anywhere and any time, it is easy to follow the trends of lifelong learning. Therefore,
            people in the current society should develop in their formal education, in their jobs but also in informal
            education. All of these is offered by

            new technology BYOD (Bring Your Own Device). Mobile learning or shortly m-learning
            is becoming more and more popular outside the borders of Croatia and now Croatia
            is slowly trying to keep up with the newest trends in both education and job training
            using smartphones or tablets as valuable didactic tools. In order to become a more
            attractive and developed country, we need to implement new technologies in our
            lives and not only in the students’ classrooms where the education begins. The aim
            of the study is to explore teachers’ attitudes towards mobile technologies among the
            teachers in the Republic of Croatia. There were 208 teachers of all school subjects included in the study.
            When it comes to mobile learning, participants expressed their
            approval of students using mobile technologies in the classrom and teachers plan on
            incorporating mobile learning in the teaching process.
