        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            History is first taught independently as a science and as a school subject in the 5th
            grade of primary school. In addition to the compulsory subject in primary school,
            history is taught to various degrees in different secondary schools. With the school
            year of 2021/2022, a project named School for Life finished and, hence, curricula were
            introduced in primary schools and gymnasiums for the first time. Although a significant change in the
            teaching paradigm was expected with the introduction of the History curriculum, the question arises as to
            what changes have actually taken place.
            The state considers history to be extremely important for the creation of, above all,
            national and other identities. Historically, because of such aspirations, political history has been
            dominating history teaching for decades. The curricular separation
            of the educational outcomes of History into five domains theoretically opens up the
            possibility of strengthening interdisciplinary approach to history teaching. The implementation of such a
            possibility can be explored by a more detailed analysis of
            teachers’ work and indirectly by the analysis of the content of the textbook. Since
            teachers have selected new textbooks in the past three years, which have been approved by the Ministry of
            Science and Education, it is to be expected that classes will
            generally be held in accordance with the materials available in them. The paper
            compares the changes in the interdisciplinarity of total of twelve 7th and 8th grade
            primary school textbooks published in 2014 with the new textbooks published in
            2020/2021.
