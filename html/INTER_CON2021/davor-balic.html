        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            The opus of the Croatian polymath Miroslav Krleža (1893–1981) contains his judgment of the teachings of
            numerous philosophers, including the German philosopher
            Immanuel Kant (1724–1804). However, regardless of the fact that Krleža often expressed his thoughts on
            Kant’s teaching, moreover he devoted a separate article to it
            in 1924 (“On the Occasion of the Bicentenary of Imanuel Kant’s Birth”), researchers
            of Krleža have, according to my knowledge, rarely or incidentally pointed out his
            attitudes towards that eminent German philosopher thus far. In fact, two short texts
            regarding Krleža’s thoughts on Kant have been published until the present day. Both
            of them were written by art historian Andrej Žmegač for the entries of the Krležijana
            encyclopedia: one for the entry “Kant, Immanuel,” and the other for the entry “‘On
            the Occasion of the Bicentenary of Immanuel Kant’s Birth’.”
            When he was judging Kant’s teaching in his opus, Krleža took, among others, an interdisciplinary approach.
            As expected, he judged Kant from a philosophical perspective, especially from the perspective of logic,
            theory of knowledge and ethics, but
            also from, also as expected, a literary perspective, especially in his dramas, novellas
            and novels. However, he also judged him from a historical, political and artistic perspective, and even from
            the medical and anthropological one.
            Krleža often criticized Kant’s teaching and considered it close to the Middle Ages,
            whereat I single out his statements from the aforementioned article “On the Occasion of the Bicentenary of
            Imanuel Kant’s Birth,” in which he said that “everything
            is as impenetrable as a fortress wall in the Middle Ages” in Kant's teaching and that
            “Kant smells like alchemical sulfur and magic.” But, he also often pointed out Kant’s
            exceptional value and influence. For example, in the essay “Francisco José Goya y
            Lucientes” (1926) he claimed that the 18th century was a century of “Kant and Mozart” and that Kant was one
            of the “giants” and one of the “monumental figures,”
            while in his polemical writing “Dialectical Antibarbarus” (1939) he said that he had
            “cited Immanuel the Great.”
