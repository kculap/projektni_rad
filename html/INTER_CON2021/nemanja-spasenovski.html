        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            The school system is a subsystem of society. Systems theory emphasizes the system
            as a whole and explains the origin and development of the organization and the behavior of the system with
            the aim of creating methods and order in solving problems.
            We derive the term “organization” from the Greek word “organon”. The emergence
            of the organization was conditioned by the division of labor. The division of labor
            explains the social structure, the development of the profession, and the functioning
            of the various subsystems in the organization. Education can be viewed as a dynamic
            process that nowadays requires to be efficiently and effectively managed with the
            aim of achieving an overall market advantage, both of individuals (users) and organizational groups
            (schools). Due to postmodernist changes that affect all aspects of
            social life, and consequently education, it is necessary that the education system and
            those who manage it have quality answers if it is to be made competitive and current
            in the market. Quality solutions in the organizational sense are not only conditioned
            by market competitiveness, but also by the need to preserve the humanistic component which the education
            system represents. Education is the face of every nation. As
            mentioned above, it is necessary to develop effective mechanisms and effective strategic management in the
            educational sector, which will enable to obtain adequate,
            true and verifiable information about the real educational needs that exist within a
            particular social community. Without harmonization of the labor market and education, it is not possible to
            achieve educational goals and tasks in a quality and efficient
            manner. The aim of this paper is to show the importance of strategic management of
            this sector precisely because of the importance of education.
