        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            This paper analyzes specifics of philosophical, psychological, sociological, anthropological and pedagogical
            interpretations of values by interdisciplinary analysis of
            value phenomena. Two approaches were detected: deductive-theoretical and inductive-empirical. The first is
            not focused on empirical research and emphasizes the
            universal aspect of values and often neglects the relativism of values, which potentially leads to
            normativism (which often was more than common in pedagogy). The
            second approach, the inductive-empirical one, in its interpretations (especially in
            psychology) is often positivistically oriented.
            The paper starts from an affirmative hypothesis: that value analysis which is isolated
            from philosophy, sociology, psychology, pedagogy and anthropology, and which is
            without knowledge of the diversity of their concrete forms within different cultures
            and without sufficient research of different types of value relations, leads to positivist
            and/or metaphysical interpretations. The analytical discourse of this paper goes in
            the direction of Theory of convergence in “reconciling” theoretical and empirical
            analysis, because acceptable scientific-methodological and analytical discourse do
            not allow strict separation, let alone opposition of these two approaches.
            Anthropological, sociological and philosophical studies are marked by a deductive-
            -theoretical approach, when researching and/or advocating the permanent character of certain values, while
            the empirical-inductive approach, mainly of psychological studies, registers a changing aspect of values.
            The specificity of the pedagogical
            definition of value is that it is treated as a “driving and regulating act of education”
            (Mougniotte).

            This paper actualizes the differences in the universal character of values and (radical) moral relativism,
            dualism of values and the division into explicit (proclaimed)
            and implicit (behavioral) values. This paper explains why the definition of value, as
            a set of enduring beliefs and individual and/or social standards of behavior, is the
            most acceptable. The changing character of values determines social reality, and
            the universal character determines values – types of value orientations. In support
            of this statement, psychologist Milton Rokeach offered a great thesis: “If values were
            completely stable, individual and social change would be impossible. If values were
            completely unstable, continuity of human personality and society would be impossible. Any approach to human
            values must be able to explain the enduring nature of
            values as well as their variability.”
            The paper brings education and values into a purposeful relationship, and distinguishes between values and
            ideals, norms, attitudes, goals, value judgments, value
            systems, lifestyles and value orientations. Finally, the consequences of value inversion as a crisis of
            education are analyzed and the operational definition of the goal
            of education is given.
