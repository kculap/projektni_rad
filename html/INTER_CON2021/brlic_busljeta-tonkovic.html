        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            An interdisciplinary project will be presented which comprises both the theoretical
            framework and empirical findings of rural sociology, sociology of development, demography, social geography,
            contemporary history and environmental history, as
            well as of social ecology. Considering that the field of rural sociology is the object
            of study of only few sociologists in Croatia, the contribution of this project proposal
            would be most notable in this very regard. By addressing modernization and (post)
            transition processes in the traditional region of Lika, which is rural according to its
            characteristics, the proposed project sets the foundations for studying the processes
            which have led to the demographic abandonment and comprehensive impoverishment of Croatian rural regions,
            i.e. of rural regions in general. Lika is a rural-periphery area, although it represents a connection of a
            kind between the north and south
            parts of Croatia. What is more, Lika (along with the wider area of Upland Croatia) is
            a connection between the developed part of Central Europe and the underdeveloped
            area of South-Eastern Europe. Therefore, it makes sense to use the example of the
            Lika rural area to analyze – by employing a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary
            approach – the characteristics which will make up the criteria for evaluating general
            social development of rural areas. In more concrete terms, the project would establish – based on a
            multidisciplinary study of Lika – interdisciplinary criteria for evaluating modernization and
            (post)transition processes of Croatian rural areas. Based
            on those criteria and additional research in other rural areas, the research group
            would draw up universal ideal-type criteria for evaluating the entire rural territory
            of Croatia (with regard to the following dimensions: sociocultural, economic, ecological and political).
            Later, the group would modify those criteria within the scope
            of future research projects and use them to evaluate development processes in the
            rural areas of EU acceding countries. These countries have gone through and/or still
            go through similar stages of modernization and (post)transition processes.
